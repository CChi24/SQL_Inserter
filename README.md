# SQL_Inserter
Simple SQL insert and display

# How Does it Work?
This sql inserter takes in a user-inputted content in a small form asking for their first name and last name.
When the user finishes entering their data, the program will check to see that the data they entered are ONLY letters and 
not numbers or symbols.
There a two actions the user can take:
* 'Add to Database' 
or 
* 'Display last Insert'

If the user clicks 'Add to Database', it will add the user's first name and last name to the database.
If the user clicks 'Display last entry', it will display the first data entry in the database table in a textbox; the program will check to see if there are any data
entries before displaying data as well.
